# Picture-in-Picture Everywhere

A simple Browser Extension (right now it's targeted at Chrome-based Browsers) to make use of the [Picture-in-Picture Web API](https://wicg.github.io/picture-in-picture/) on any website
regardless of wether the website would like you to only watch a video in that browser tab.

The original work was done by the pepole from the Google Chrome Labs Picture-in-Picture-extension [https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/picture-in-picture-chrome-extension].
